# Security Checklist for Dew Auth Server

This checklist covers security considerations for the Dew Auth Server deployment. It should be reviewed regularly and before each major release.

## OAuth 2.0 Implementation

- [ ] Authorization Code grant is implemented with PKCE for all clients
- [ ] Access tokens have appropriate lifetimes (typically 1 hour)

- [ ] Token introspection endpoint is properly secured
- [ ] Token revocation endpoint is properly implemented
- [ ] Proper validation of redirect URIs against registered URIs
- [ ] CSRF protection with state parameter is enabled and enforced
- [ ] Scope validation and enforcement is correctly implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to all critical endpoints

## Authentication & Session Management

- [ ] Password hashing uses bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- [ ] Session tokens are properly secured and have appropriate timeouts
- [ ] Session rotation on login/logout is implemented
- [ ] Session data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication is available for critical operations
- [ ] Brute force protection is implemented for login/user endpoints

## Infrastructure Security
